# NBA Regular Season Award Predictions

In this project, I will be using the nba_api Python package to retrieve current data on league standings and player statistics in order to make predictions on regular season awards such as MVP, All-Stars or All-NBA teams. The predictions are made using the machine learning model trained on the data from last 25 NBA seasons.

The predictions are hosted on Streamlit and can be viewed on:
