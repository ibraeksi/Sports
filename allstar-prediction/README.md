# NBA All-Star Prediction
Every year, around the midpoint of the season in February, NBA organizes an exhibition game called the All-Star game. 24 of the best players in the league are chosen as the All-Stars to play in this game as voted by fans, media, fellow players and coaches. Being an all-star is regarded as a great achievement and therefore has been used as a metric in ranking the players historically. Usually team success and player performance are used by the voters in their selections. 

The goal of this study is to gather pre-all-star break data from the official NBA stats website and develop a machine learning model that can predict the current seasons's all-stars based on per game stats.
