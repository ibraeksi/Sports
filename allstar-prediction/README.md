The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America, currently composed of 30 teams (29 in the US and 1 in Canada). It is the best basketball league in the world attracting the best players from around the world. Every year, around the midpoint of the season in February, they organize an exhibition game called the All-Star game. 24 of the best players in the league are chosen as the All-Stars to play in this game as voted by fans, media, fellow players and coaches.

Being an all-star is regarded as a great achievement and therefore has been used as a metric in ranking the players historically. Usually team success and player performance are used by the voters in their selections. The goal of this study is to gather pre-all-star break data from the official NBA stats website to see if we can develop a machine learning model that can predict this year's all-stars based on per game stats.
