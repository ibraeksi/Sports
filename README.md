# NBA Analytics
As a huge NBA fan, I like making predictions or drawing conclusions based on team / player performance. The NBA is also a great data source as 30 teams play 82 regular season games with each game providing 10s of different stats that can be used in a variety of analysis. Most of these stats are publicly available on the official NBA website or many other useful sites like Basketball Reference.

Here, I will try to answer some of the questions I come up with as I follow the league by using data analysis and machine learning.
